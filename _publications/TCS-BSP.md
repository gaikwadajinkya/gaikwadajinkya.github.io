permalink: /publication/2021-Parameterized complexity of satisfactory partition problem
excerpt: ' We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity. The main results of the paper are the following: (1) Satisfactory Partition is polynomial-time solvable for block graphs, (2) Satisfactory Partition and Balanced Satisfactory Partition are fixed parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by neighbourhood diversity. (3) Satisfactory Partition and its balanced version can be solved in polynomial time for graphs of bounded clique-width, and (4) Balanced Satisfactory Partition is W[1]-hard when parameterized by treewidth.'
