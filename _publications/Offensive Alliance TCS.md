excerpt: 'The {\sc Offensive Alliance} problem has been studied extensively during the last twenty years. A set $S\subseteq V$ of vertices is an \emph{offensive alliance}  in an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ if
 each  $v\in N(S)$ has at least as many neighbours in $S$ as it has neighbours (including itself)
 not in $S$.   
We study the classical and parameterized complexity of the 
{\sc Offensive Alliance} problem, where the aim is to find a minimum size
offensive alliance.
We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized 
complexity   by showing that (1)
the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by a wide range of 
fairly restrictive structural parameters such as the feedback vertex set number, treewidth, pathwidth, and treedepth of the input graph; this puts it among the few problems that are FPT when parameterized by solution size but not when parameterized by treewidth (unless FPT=W[1]),
(2) the problem cannot be solved in time $\mathcal{O}^{*}(2^{o(k \log k)})$ where $k$ is the solution size, unless ETH fails,
(3) it does not admit a polynomial kernel parameterized by solution size and vertex cover of the input graph.
On the positive side we prove that
(4) it can be solved in time $\mathcal{O}^{*}(\tt{vc(G)}^{\mathcal{O}(\tt{vc(G)})})$ where $\tt{vc(G)}$ is the vertex cover number of the input graph.
(5) it admits an FPT algorithm when parameterized by vertex integrity of input graph.
In terms of classical complexity, we prove that (6) the problem cannot be solved in time  $2^{o(n)}$ even when restricted to bipartite graphs, unless  ETH fails, (7)  it  cannot be solved in time $2^{o(\sqrt{n})}$  even when restricted to apex graphs, unless  ETH fails. We also prove that  (8)  it  is NP-complete even when restricted to bipartite, chordal, split and circle graphs.'
