excerpt: ' We study the parameterized complexity of the Offensive Alliance problem, where the aim is to find a minimum size offensive alliance. Our focus here lies on parameters that measure the structural properties of the input instance. We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity by showing that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by a wide range of fairly restrictive structural parameters such as the feedback vertex set number, treewidth, pathwidth, and treedepth of the input graph.
