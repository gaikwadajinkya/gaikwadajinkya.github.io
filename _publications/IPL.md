excerpt: ' We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity by showing that the Globally Minimal Defensive Alliance problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treewidth of the graph. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm when the input graph happens to be a tree.'
