excerpt: 'Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and  a set $\mathcal{F}$ of forbidden subgraphs, we study the
{\sc $\mathcal{F}$-Free Edge Deletion} problem, where
the goal is to remove a minimum number of edges such that the resulting graph does not contain any $F\in \mathcal{F}$ as a
(not necessarily induced) subgraph.  Enright and Meeks (Algorithmica, 2018) gave an algorithm to solve {\sc $\mathcal{F}$-Free  Edge Deletion} whose running time on an $n$-vertex graph $G$ of treewidth ${\sf tw}(G)$ is bounded by  
$2^{O(|\mathcal{F}|{\sf tw}(G)^r)}n$,  if every graph in $\mathcal{F}$ has at most $r$ vertices.
We complement this result by showing that {\sc $\mathcal{F}$-Free Edge Deletion} is W[1]-hard when parameterized by  ${\sf tw}(G)+|\mathcal{F}|$.  We also show that {\sc $\mathcal{F}$-Free Edge Deletion}  is W[2]-hard when parameterized by the combined parameters solution size, the feedback vertex set number and pathwidth of the input graph.
A special case of particular interest is the situation in which $\mathcal{F}$ is the set 
$\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$ of all trees on $h+1$ vertices, so that we delete edges in order to obtain a graph
in which every component contains at most $h$ vertices. This is  desirable from the point of view of restricting the 
spread of a disease in transmission networks \cite{kitty}.  We prove that  {\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Edge Deletion}
 is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the vertex 
cover number of the input graph. We also prove that it admits a kernel with $2kh$ 
vertices and $2kh^2+k$ edges, when parameterized by  $k+h$. '
