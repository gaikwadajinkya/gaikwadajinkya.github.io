excerpt: 'The Satisfactory Partition problem asks whether it is possible to partition the vertex set of a given undirected graph into two parts such that each vertex has at least as many neighbours in its own part as in the other part. The Balanced Satisfactory Partition problem is a variant of the above problem where the two partite sets are required to have the same cardinality. Both problems are known to be NP-complete but its parameterized complexity remains open until now. We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity.'
