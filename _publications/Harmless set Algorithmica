excerpt: 'In this paper, we study the {\sc Harmless Set} problem from a parameterized complexity perspective. Given a graph $G = (V,E)$, a threshold function$~t~ :~ V \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$  and an integer $k$,
we study  {\sc Harmless Set}, where the goal is to find a subset of vertices 
$S \subseteq V$ of size at least$~k$ such that every vertex $v\in V$ has fewer than $t(v)$ neighbours in $S$. On the positive side, we obtain fixed-parameter algorithms for 
the problem when parameterized by the neighbourhood diversity, the twin-cover number and the vertex integrity  of the input graph.
We complement two of these results from the negative side. 
On dense graphs, we show that the  problem is~W[1]-hard parameterized by cluster vertex deletion number -- a natural generalization of the twin-cover number. 
We  show that the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by a wide range of fairly 
restrictive structural parameters such as the feedback vertex set number, pathwidth, and treedepth -- a natural generalization of the vertex integrity. We thereby resolve one open question stated by Bazgan and  Chopin (\emph{Discrete Optimization}, 2014) concerning the complexity of {\sc Harmless Set} parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. 
We also show that {\sc Harmless Set}  for a special case where each vertex has the threshold set to half of its degree (the so-called {\sc Majority Harmless Set}  problem) 
 is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. 
Given a graph $G$ and an irredundant $c$-expression of $G$, we prove that  {\sc Harmless Set}  can be solved in XP-time when parameterized by clique-width.'
