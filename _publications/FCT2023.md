excerpt: ' Given an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and two integers $k$ and $h$, we study 
{\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Edge Deletion}, where
the goal is to remove at most $k$ edges such that the resulting graph 
does not contain any tree on $h+1$ vertices as a
(not necessarily induced) subgraph, that is,  we delete at most $k$ edges in order to obtain a graph
in which every component contains at most $h$ vertices. This is  desirable from the point of view of restricting the 
spread of a disease in transmission networks. 
Enright and Meeks (Algorithmica, 2018) gave an algorithm to solve {\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Edge Deletion} whose running time on an $n$-vertex graph $G$ of treewidth ${\sf tw}(G)$ is bounded by $O(({\sf tw}(G)h)^{2{\sf tw}(G)}n)$.
However, it remains open whether the problem might belong to FPT when parameterized only by the treewidth ${\sf tw}(G)$; they conjectured that treewidth alone is not enough, and that the problem is W[1]-hard with respect to this parameterization. We resolve this conjecture by showing that {\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Edge Deletion} is indeed W[1]-hard when parameterized by  ${\sf tw}(G)$ alone. 
%On the positive side, we prove that the {\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Edge Deletion} problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the solution size $k$.
%Enright and Meeks (Algorithmica, 2018) explained the importance of studying  {\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Edge Deletion} on planar graphs and  directed graphs. 
%One question of particular relevance to epidemiology would be the complexity of the problem on planar graphs; this would be relevant for considering the spread of a disease based on the geographic location. 
We resolve  two additional open questions posed by Enright and Meeks (Algorithmica, 2018) concerning the complexity of  {\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Edge Deletion} on planar graphs and {\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Arc Deletion}. We prove that the {\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Edge Deletion} problem is NP-complete even when restricted to planar graphs. We also show that 
the  {\sc $\mathcal{T}_{h+1}$-Free Arc Deletion} problem is W[2]-hard when parameterized by the solution size on directed acyclic graphs.
