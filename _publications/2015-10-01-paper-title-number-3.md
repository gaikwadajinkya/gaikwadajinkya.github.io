excerpt: 'The Satisfactory Partition problem consists in deciding if the set of vertices of a given undirected graph can be partitioned into two nonempty parts such that each vertex has at least as many neighbours in its part as in the other part. This problem is known to be NP-complete. It was introduced by Gerber and Kobler and further studied by other authors. We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity.'
