My name is Ajinkya Gaikwad and I am a PhD student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune. My primary interest is to address computationally hard problems which are characterization of real life situations and deal with them using parameterized complexity theory. Parameterized complexity theory is a branch of complexity theory that deals with NP-hard problems to address the issue of classification of such problems according to their difficulty with respect to different input and output parameters. A parameterized problem has an input instance x as well as a parameter k which is sufficiently small compare to the size of the input instance. A parameterized problem is FPT (fixed parameter tractable) if there exists an algorithm which correctly decides whether the input instance of the given problem is a yes or no instance in time which is polynomial in the size of the input instance but possibly exponential in k. Certain parameterized problems are unlikely to be fixed parameter tractable; there seems to be different levels of hardness in parameterized complexity theory. Downey and Fellows introduced the W-hierarchy in an attempt to classify parameterized problems according to their hardness. In this project, we have considered the following computational problems: defensive and offensive alliances in graphs; the satisfactory partition problem; the harmless set problem; upper defensive alliances; upper edge dominating set problem; minimal feedback vertex set problem
