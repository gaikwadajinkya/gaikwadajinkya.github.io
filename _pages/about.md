I’m **Ajinkya Gaikwad**, a researcher working in **graph algorithms** and **parameterized complexity**.  
My work focuses on kernelization and distance-bounded **graph modification** problems (e.g., cluster/club variants and vertex/edge editing). I enjoy designing fixed-parameter algorithms with provable guarantees and clean structural insights.

I will be conducting scientific research at **CTU Prague**, and previously studied at **IISER Pune**.

**Research interests:** parameterized algorithms, kernelization, graph modification, clustering problems, structural graph theory.

If you’d like a one-page CV on the site, place `cv.pdf` in the repo and I’ll link it here.
