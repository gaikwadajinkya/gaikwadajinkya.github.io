We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity. Our focus lies on parameters that measure the structural properties of the input instance. We show that the Harmless Set problem with majority thresholds is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the treewidth of the input graph. On the positive side, we obtain a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for the problem with respect to neighbourhood diversity.",

abstract = {A set S of vertices of a graph is a defensive alliance if, for each element of S, the majority of its neighbours is in S. We consider the notion of local minimality in this paper. We are interested in locally minimal defensive alliance of maximum size. This problem is known to be NP-hard but its parameterized complexity remains open until now. We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity. The main results of the paper are the following: (1) Locally Minimal Defensive Alliance is NP-complete, even when restricted to planar graphs, (2) a randomized FPT algorithm for Exact Connected Locally Minimal Defensive Alliance parameterized by solution size, (3) Locally Minimal Defensive Alliance is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by neighbourhood diversity, (4) Locally Minimal Defensive Alliance parameterized by treewidth is W[1]-hard and thus not FPT (unless FPT=W[1]), (5) Locally Minimal Defensive Alliance can be solved in polynomial time for graphs of bounded treewidth.}

abstract = {Given an undirected graph G, we study the Satisfactory Partition problem, where the goal is to decide whether it is possible to partition the vertex set of G into two parts such that each vertex has at least as many neighbours in its own part as in the other part. The Balanced Satisfactory Partition problem is a variant of the above problem where the two partite sets are required to have the same cardinality. Both problems are known to be NP-complete. This problem was introduced by Gerber and Kobler (2000) [9] and further studied by other authors, but its parameterized complexity remains open until now. We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity. The main results of the paper are the following: (1) Satisfactory Partition is polynomial-time solvable for block graphs, (2) Satisfactory Partition and Balanced Satisfactory Partition are fixed parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by neighbourhood diversity. (3) Satisfactory Partition and its balanced version can be solved in polynomial time for graphs of bounded clique-width, and (4) Balanced Satisfactory Partition is W[1]-hard when parameterized by treewidth.}
